- 👋 Hi, I’m @schulzes
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program apps that use technology to help improve the quality of people's lives, especially when it comes to accessing higher quality care in mental health. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...basic coding! I have a long way to go, but a strong work ethic. Fingers crossed! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet, since I'm just learning the ropes, but I love projects and places that use technology to augment people's reality, like Geocaching, Zest, Fluyo, Drops . . . and the ideas behind Pokemon GO! I'm a Center for Humane Technology Podcast fan. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
